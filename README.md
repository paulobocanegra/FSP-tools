# Fullstack Data Flow & Styling
#### Phase 1: Fullstack Data Flow
1. run `npm start` and go to the browser.
2. At `localhost:3000/` you will find a list of buttons. Each button represents the named function in your fullstack application (feel free to place debuggers on each one of them). When submiting the form to log in, what is the order in which these functions will run? Click the functions in the order we expect them to excecute.

#### Phase 2: Fullstack CSS demo
1. At `localhost:3000/fsp-style` you will find a built ui for an e-commerce with a side bar. 
2. Check css files to understand how to build this UI.
